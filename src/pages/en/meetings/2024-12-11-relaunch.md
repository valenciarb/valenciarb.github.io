**Valencia.rb** is being re-launched after a nearly 5 years hiatus.

Our re-launch event couldn't be better! The [Ruby Europe](https://rubyeurope.com) initiative has given us the motivation we needed to start talking again about the language we're so passionate about: **Ruby**.

At our next meeting, we are pleased to have [Rosa Gutiérrez](https://rosa.codes), a programmer at [37Signals](https://37signals.com), and [Yauhen Karatkou], Barcelona.rb organizer and Lead Ruby Developer at Tripledot Studios.

We also have the support of [New Work Valencia](https://new-work.se/en/career/valencia) who will let us meet in their offices.

**We'll see you on December 10th**

You can't miss it!

##### Agenda

**Solid Queue internals, externals and all the things in between**

  _"We’ve used Resque and Redis to run background jobs in multiple apps
  for many years at 37signals. However, performance, reliability,
  and our own apps’ idiosyncrasies led us to use a lot of different gems,
  some developed by us, some forked or patched to address our struggles.
  After multiple war stories with background jobs, looking at our increasingly
  complex setup, we wanted something we could use out-of-the-box without having
  to port our collection of hacks to every new app and with fewer moving pieces.
  After exploring existing alternatives, we decided to build our own and aim to
  make it the default for Rails 8. In this talk, I’ll present Solid Queue,
  explain some of the problems we had over the years, how we designed
  Solid Queue to address them, and all the Fun™ we had doing that."_

**Demystifying JIT Compilers with Ruby YJIT**

  _"In this topic, we will explore the wonderful world of Just-in-Time compilation, take a look at how Ruby JIT has evolved along with the language itself. And what impact the newest versions of Ruby can have on the performance of real applications._"
