**Valencia.rb** is being re-launched after a nearly 5 years hiatus.

Our re-launch event couldn't be better! The [Ruby Europe](https://rubyeurope.com) initiative has given us the motivation we needed to start talking again about the language we're so passionate about: **Ruby**.

At our next meeting, we are pleased to have [Rosa Gutiérrez](https://rosa.codes), a programmer at [37Signals](https://37signals.com) (_the company behind [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) and products like [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) and [Hey](https://www.hey.com)_).

We also have the support of [New Work Valencia]() who will let us meet in their offices.

**We'll see you on November 6th**

You can't miss it!

**Agenda**

- **Intro**: Ruby Europe Initiative
- **Charla**: [Rosa Gutiérrez](https://rosa.codes) - _**Solid Queue internals, externals and all the things in between**_ (_la misma charla que dio en [Ruby Word 2024](https://rubyonrails.org/world/2024/day-1/rosa-gutierrez)_)
