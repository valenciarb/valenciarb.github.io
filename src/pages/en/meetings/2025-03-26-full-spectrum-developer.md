![Full Spectrum Developer](../../../images/full-spectrum.jpg)

This time [Enrique Comba Riepenhausen](https://ecomba.pro) will talk about **_The Full Spectrum Developer_**, a concept
inspired by Laurence Gellert's post "[What is a Full Stack Developer?](https://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/)" that
took the industry by storm.

In his talk Enrique will share his view of what a _"full spectrum developer"_ is and why being one will be a game-changer for your professional development.

[New Work](https://new-work.se/en/career/valencia) have kindly offered us their space to meet and have a good
time together.

**See you Wednesday the 26th!**
