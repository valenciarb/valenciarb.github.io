# 🚀 The Spain Triangle Project: Where Ruby Meets Spanish Passion 🇪🇸

**Exciting news for the tech community!** Ruby Europe is proud to present the Spain Triangle Project - an initiative to awaken and unite Ruby enthusiasts across Spain.

## 🗓️ Mark Your Calendars:

- Nov 5: Barcelona (Loft de Gràcia)
- Nov 6: Valencia (New Work office) – _[see more](#next_meeting)_
- Nov 7: Madrid (Lingokids office)

## 🌟 Why Attend?

- Learn from top Ruby developers
- Share your experiences and challenges
- Help shape the future of Ruby in Spain
- Be part of a growing, dynamic tech community

This is more than just a series of meetups - it's a journey to unlock the potential of Spain's
Ruby community. Spain has been a hidden gem, with many Ruby developers and companies,
but lacking a united community.

**Let's change that together!**
