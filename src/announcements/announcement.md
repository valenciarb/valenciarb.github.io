# ‼️ Event Postponed ‼️

The Valencia.rb organization has decided to postpone the next Meetup from November 6th.

As a community, our priority is to offer a quality event and a safe space, and today we cannot guarantee that people can attend the event without any kind of risk for both speakers and attendees.

At the same time, we stand in solidarity with the families, friends, and colleagues affected by DANA.

If you can help people affected by DANA, please donate to the [Red Cross](https://cercadeti.cruzroja.es/ayudaafectadosinundacionesdana) or [Caritas](https://www.caritas.es/emergencias/graves-inundaciones/).

_Note: DANA is a Spanish acronym for "Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos" (Isolated Depression at High Levels), which refers to a severe weather phenomenon that can cause heavy rainfall and flooding._
